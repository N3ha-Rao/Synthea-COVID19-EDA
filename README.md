# Synthea COVID-19 Data Exploration

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) generated by [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) with a focus on COVID-19-related data.
Synthea is an open-source tool that generates synthetic patient data, providing realistic but not real health records for research and analysis.

## Datasets

The analysis utilizes the Synthea COVID-19 dataset, which can be downloaded directly from the command line. The following CSV files are analyzed:

- `patients.csv`: Contains demographic information of patients.
- `encounters.csv`: Details of patient encounters with healthcare providers.
- `conditions.csv`: Records of medical conditions diagnosed in patients.

### Download Instructions

**Using `wget`:**

```bash
wget -O 10k_synthea_covid19_csv.zip "https://mitre.box.com/shared/static/9iglv8kbs1pfi7z8phjl9sbpjk08spze.zip"
```

**Using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -L -o 10k_synthea_covid19_csv.zip "https://mitre.box.com/shared/static/9iglv8kbs1pfi7z8phjl9sbpjk08spze.zip"
```

After downloading, extract the contents using:

```bash
unzip 10k_synthea_covid19_csv.zip
```

Ensure that the extracted CSV files are in the same directory as the analysis script.

## Analysis Overview

1. **Patient Demographics**:
   - **Age Distribution**: Visualization of patient ages.
   - **Gender Distribution**: Breakdown of patients by gender.

2. **Encounter Analysis**:
   - **Encounters per Year**: Trend of healthcare encounters over time.
   - **Encounter Types**: Distribution of different types of healthcare encounters.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - **Most Common Conditions**: Identification of the top 10 diagnosed conditions.
   - **Conditions by Gender**: Analysis of condition prevalence across genders.

## Visualizations

The analysis generates several plots saved as PNG files:

- `age_distribution.png`
- `gender_distribution.png`
- `encounters_per_year.png`
- `encounter_types.png`
- `common_conditions.png`
- `conditions_by_gender.png`
